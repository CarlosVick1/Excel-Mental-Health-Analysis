# Excel-Mental-Health-Analysis
This is an Excel project visualizing a mental health dataset gathered in 2014/2015.
The analysis, pivot table, and dashboard were carried out to highlight the mental health patients in the dataset.
The data was collected from the Kaggle website in CSV format at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavikjikadara/mental-health-dataset.
it was converted to XLSX format during the analysis and was converted to XLSB format to reduce the size for GitHub compatibility.
